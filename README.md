## FAQ

### What is Auxilium?
Auxilium is a free-to-play two player experience. You're selected to play-test a program for an unidentified company.

You and a partner must complete puzzles and find out what lies underneath.

You can either help your partner; or betray them for selfish gain.

A singleplayer campaign will also be released eventually.

### When can I play it?
We expect to release Auxilium around May to August 2022, however it may take longer or shorter.

### Will the game be free to play?
Yes! We have released a demo of 5 multiplayer levels and 1 singleplayer level here, which you can download here.

The game may change as we develop it, so beware!

### Are you looking for any help on the project?
Currently, no. However, we may be looking for helpers in the future.

### Will there be any other releases for other OS'?
Linux support may happen. Mac support is unlikely. No Chromebook support.
