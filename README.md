## FAQ

## #What is Auxilium?
Auxilium is a free-to-play two player experience. You're selected to play-test a program for an unidentified company.

You and a partner must complete puzzles and find out what lies underneath.

You can either help your partner; or betray them for selfish gain.

A singleplayer campaign will also be released eventually.

### When can I play it?
We expect to release Auxilium around May to August 2022, however it may take longer or shorter.

### Will the game be free to play?
Yes! We have released a demo of 5 multiplayer levels and 1 singleplayer level here, which you can download.

The game may change as we develop it, so beware!
